"""Built-in tool schema definitions for Open-Claw Layer 5.

Defines ToolDefinition records for the three core tool slots:
  FILE_READ       — describe reading a file
  FILE_WRITE      — describe writing a file
  COMMAND_PREVIEW — describe a shell command without running it

SAFETY GUARANTEE
================
This module NEVER imports or calls:
  subprocess, os.system, os.popen, shutil, exec, eval,
  PowerShell, bash, shell, or any network/execution primitive.

These are definition-only records. No file is read or written by this
module; no command is executed. vault/core/ is never touched.
